# goclip

A cross-platform tool (Windows & macOS) that types text into **any** focused window (even web/VNC/VM consoles) using **real keyboard events**.  
Built with [Fyne](https://fyne.io/) for a clean dark-mode GUI.

---

## Why?

Some apps and browser-embedded consoles (e.g. VMware/KVM) ignore Unicode paste or `WM_CHAR` messages. **goclip** simulates **physical key presses** using OS-native APIs, so those consoles receive input exactly like a real keyboard would.

- **Windows**: Uses scan codes via `SendInput` with `VkKeyScanExW`/`MapVirtualKeyExW`
- **macOS**: Uses Core Graphics events (`CGEvent`) for keyboard simulation

---

## Features

- **Target window selection** from a dropdown  
  - Or click **Clear** → nothing selected means **“use last active window”** automatically.
- **Layout-aware typing** using OS keyboard layouts
  - **Windows**: Multiple keyboard layouts supported via `VkKeyScanExW`/`MapVirtualKeyExW` with scan codes
  - **macOS**: Uses system keyboard layout with Unicode character injection
  - **Unicode fallback** for unmappable characters.
- **Modifier compatibility mode** that sends Alt/Shift/AltGr via hardware scan codes for stubborn consoles (Citrix Workspace, HPE iLO, etc.)
- **Modern dark-mode GUI** (Fyne)
- **Localized UI** – auto-detects your OS language with an in-app dropdown to switch (currently English & German)
- **No install required** – single portable binary
- **Cross-platform** – Windows and macOS supported

### Modifier Compatibility Mode

Many remote console apps swallow modifier keys, so goclip exposes a dedicated **Modifier Compatibility** selector (Auto / Force On / Force Off). The Auto mode watches the selected/last active window and seamlessly flips to hardware scan-code modifiers for known problematic apps, including:

- **Citrix Workspace / Viewer** (`wfica32.exe`, `CitrixWorkspace.exe`, `CDViewer.exe`, etc.)
- **HPE iLO Integrated Remote Console** (all native and rebranded console launchers)

If another tool misbehaves, simply set the selector to **Force On** to keep modifiers in scan-code mode for that session.

## Example Demo (VMware VM Console)
- the example shows, how the multilanguage input works
- the starting point is USA Layout, and a chain of random test comands and at the end a loadkey to change to german keyboard layout
- then a quick change in the GUI to german target language
- and firing the same commands again
- (the purple bar around gui is for always on top)

## Supported keyboard layouts

### Windows

- Auto (Use System)
- English (US)
- US International
- English (UK)
- German (DE)
- French (FR)
- Spanish (ES)
- Italian (IT)
- Dutch (NL)
- Portuguese (BR - ABNT2)
- Portuguese (PT)
- Danish (DA)
- Swedish (SV)
- Finnish (FI)
- Norwegian (NO)
- Swiss German (DE-CH)
- Swiss French (FR-CH)
- Polish (Programmers)
- Czech (CS)
- Slovak (SK)
- Hungarian (HU)
- Turkish (Q)
- Russian (RU)
- Ukrainian (UK)
- Hebrew (HE)
- Arabic (AR)
- Japanese (JP)
- Korean (KO)

### macOS
macOS automatically uses the system keyboard layout. All Unicode characters are supported.

> Tip: If your target system uses a different layout than your local PC, pick the layout that matches the **target**. The mapping is performed using that layout’s OS keyboard table.

---

## How it works (high level)

### Windows
- Resolves each character (based on the chosen layout) with `VkKeyScanExW` → **virtual key** + required **modifiers**.
- Converts VK → hardware **scan code** via `MapVirtualKeyExW`.
- Sends **press/release** events with `SendInput` and `KEYEVENTF_SCANCODE`.
- If mapping fails (e.g., emoji), falls back to **Unicode injection**.

### macOS
- Uses Core Graphics (`CGEvent`) to create keyboard events
- Directly injects Unicode characters for maximum compatibility
- Activates target application before typing
- Uses `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` to enumerate windows

This is why web consoles and VMs that ignore paste/Unicode still receive keystrokes.

## Requirements

### Windows
- Windows 10/11 (x64)
- Go 1.22+ (to build)
- CGO toolchain (MinGW-w64) for Fyne

### macOS
- macOS 10.13+ (High Sierra or later)
- Go 1.22+ (to build)
- Xcode Command Line Tools (for CGO)

---

## Build

### Windows

```powershell
# in the project root
go mod tidy
go build -trimpath -ldflags="-H=windowsgui -s -w" -o goclip.exe .
```

> The `-H=windowsgui` flag hides the console window for a cleaner UX.

If you need MinGW-w64 for CGO on the GitHub runner, see the provided workflow.

### macOS

```bash
# in the project root
go mod tidy
go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w" -o goclip .
```

The built binary can be run directly or packaged into an `.app` bundle for distribution.

---

## Run

1. Launch **goclip** (on Windows: `goclip.exe`, on macOS: `./goclip` or double-click the app).
2. Pick **Keyboard Layout** (Windows only - or keep "Auto (Use System)"). On macOS, the system layout is used automatically.
3. Select a **Target Window** from the dropdown, or press **Clear** so no selection → it will use the **last active** window.
4. Type your text in the big box.
5. Click **Type**.  
   goclip briefly focuses the target window and injects keystrokes.

## GitHub Actions (preconfigured)

This repo includes workflows to build and publish binaries on push and tags:

### Windows workflow
```
.github/workflows/build-windows.yml
```

- Runs on `windows-latest`
- Installs **MinGW-w64** for CGO
- Builds `goclip-windows-amd64.exe`
- Uploads artifacts
- On tags (`v*`) also creates a **GitHub Release** and attaches the files

### macOS workflow
```
.github/workflows/build-macos.yml
```

- Runs on `macos-latest`
- Builds for both `arm64` (Apple Silicon) and `amd64` (Intel)
- Creates a universal binary that works on both architectures
- Uploads all variants as artifacts
- On tags (`v*`) also creates a **GitHub Release** and attaches the files

## GitLab CI/CD Pipeline

This repository includes a GitLab CI/CD pipeline that automatically generates a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) using [CycloneDX](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod) and uploads it to the internal Dependency-Track system.

### Pipeline Behavior

The pipeline consists of two stages:
1. **dependency-track-generate**: Generates SBOM from `go.mod` using CycloneDX
2. **dependency-track-upload**: Uploads the generated SBOM to Dependency-Track

---

## Notes & limitations

### Windows
- **Elevation:** Windows blocks sending input from a non-elevated process to an **elevated** target (UAC). If you need to type into admin apps, run goclip **as Administrator**.
- **Focus rules:** Windows sometimes restricts focus changes. We try to foreground the target just before typing, but if the target is stubborn, click it once to focus, then press **Type**.
- **CJK/IME:** For Japanese/Korean/Chinese and other IME-based input, ASCII works via scan codes. Composed characters may require IME state; Unicode fallback helps, but some web consoles ignore Unicode entirely.

### macOS
- **Accessibility permissions:** macOS may prompt for accessibility permissions the first time you run goclip. Grant access in **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility**.
- **App activation:** Some apps may not activate properly. If typing doesn't work, click the target window first, then press **Type**.
- **Unicode support:** macOS uses Unicode character injection for all characters, which works in most applications.

### Common (both platforms)
- **Browser consoles:** Ensure the console iframe has focus (click into it once).

---

## Add / customize layouts (Windows only)

On Windows, layouts are loaded by **KLID** (keyboard layout ID) using `LoadKeyboardLayoutW`. To add more entries, extend the `loadHKLByName` switch in `main.go` with the appropriate KLID:

```go
func loadHKLByName(name string) windows.Handle {
  if name == "Auto (Use System)" || name == "" {
    h, _, _ := procGetKeyboardLayout.Call(0)
    return windows.Handle(h)
  }
  klid := ""
  switch name {
  case "Belgian (Period)":
    klid = "0000080C" // example
  // add more here...
  default:
    h, _, _ := procGetKeyboardLayout.Call(0)
    return windows.Handle(h)
  }
  ptr, _ := windows.UTF16PtrFromString(klid)
  h, _, _ := procLoadKeyboardLayoutW.Call(uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(ptr)), uintptr(0))
  return windows.Handle(h)
}
```
